Hello!

I am Jackson Keppen, a junior in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University. 
I am (trying to) do research for Dr. Palmer in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics Research Group.

I am (slowly) working on modeling a Lead Slowing-Down Spectrometer (LSDS) that Dr. Palmer hopes to aqcuire from PNNL.

I am also striving for a reactor operator lisence here at the Radiation Center on OSU's campus. 

You can reach me at 541-892-3446, or email at keppenj@oregonstate.edu
