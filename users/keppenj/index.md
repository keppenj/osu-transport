Hello!

I am a junior in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University. I recently began work with Dr. Palmer, where I am modeling a Lead Slowing-Down Spectrometer that we hope to acquire from PNNL.

I am also training to receive a reactor operator lisence for the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor (OSTR).
